        <p> <b>Jason Anthony Walcott</b> created EloquentJFPro Regular after receiving his BFA in Illustration from Kean University. After graduating, Walcott fell in love with typography but still loved painting and illustrating. Because of his passions, he combined his love for typography with his illustration background to create whimsical typefaces. In particular, he basis his designs on uniquely crafted hand lettering. I chose the letterform “g” because of its circular flow and large variations in line weight.  </p>
