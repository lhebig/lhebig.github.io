                <p>My name is Lauren Hebig and I am going to tell you a few things about myself. You have come to my website to learn more about me and to be honest with you, I have to be honest with myself: I am the black sheep of my family. My father is a finance man, my sister is an IT consultant, my mother is a PR woman, my brother is a naval officer. And then there is me. Deciding to dedicate my life to design was not an easy task. Frankly, I tried everything until I landed on design. I tried my hand at performing arts, but that just proved to my eleven-year-old self that I stood no chance when it came to lying to my parents. I even tried my hand at medicine, but this cost me a few broken test tubes. But finally, I found design or rather design found me at the University of Notre Dame. Pursuing a BFA in Design and a minor in Business Economics (thanks dad), I put my witty personality to the test daily and attempt to cure the world of bad design.  </p>
